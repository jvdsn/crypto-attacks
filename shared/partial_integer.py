        :param i: the known integer
        :param bit_length: the total length of the known integer
        :param lsb_bit_length: the bit length of the unknown lsb
        :param msb_bit_length: the bit length of the unknown msb
        :return: a PartialInteger with one known component (the middle bits) and two unknown components (the lsb and msb)
